1:Need the following installed:
pip install pyotp qrcode[pil]

2:The "generate_secret" makes a string that needs to be copied and put into the "verify_secret"

Looks like the following:
secret = "REEL7JCUOHJ7TRSAHCZIODBKH2JLAXRK"  
  # Replace with your real secret


2: Using the app "FreeOTP" (icon is a spin style lock) scan the generated QR code

This will save the key. When you tap it, it shows a 6 digit code that will be the correct 2FA code

It changes every few seconds, it will still work as intended.
